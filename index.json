Specifically, by using high-throughput, experimental data for LC films exposed to diverse contaminants, we show that topological descriptors can be used to effectively detect outliers and predict contaminant concentrations using simple ML models. Notably, these models achieve comparable accuracies to those of powerful convolutional neural networks, but with much lower computational times (from hours to seconds) and using less sophisticated computing hardware.

However, when treating multi-component systems, GNNs have mostly used simple data representations (concatenation, averaging, or self-attention on features of individual components) that might fail to capture molecular interactions and potentially limit prediction accuracy. In this work, we propose a GNN architecture that captures molecular interactions in an explicit manner by combining atomic-level (local) graph convolution and molecular-level (global) message passing through a molecular interaction network. We tested the architecture (which we call SolvGNN) on a comprehensive phase equilibrium case study that aims to predict activity coefficients for a wide range of binary and ternary mixtures; we built this large dataset using the COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Real Solvation (COSMO-RS). We show that SolvGNN can predict composition-dependent activity coefficients with high accuracy and show that it outperforms a previously-developed GNN used for predicting only infinite-dilution activity coefficients. We performed counterfactual analysis on the SolvGNN model that allowed us to explore the impact of functional groups and composition on equilibrium behavior. We also used the SolvGNN model for the development of a computational framework that automatically creates phase diagrams for a diverse set of complex mixtures. All scripts needed to reproduce the results are shared as open-source code.","tags":["Graph Neural Network","Molecular Interaction"],"title":"Capturing molecular interactions in graph neural networks: a case study in multi-component phase equilibrium","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fei Long","Shengli Jiang","Adeyinka Gbenga Adekunle","Victor M Zavala","Ezra Bar-Ziv"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1668729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668729600,"objectID":"0a0934d6ba7b4c0c72a66b1bdbd9b013","permalink":"https://shenglijiang.com/publication/long2022online/","publishdate":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/long2022online/","section":"publication","summary":"To recycle the mixed plastic wastes (MPW), it is important to obtain the compositional information online in real time.

We develop the methodology using O3 and Cl2 mixtures (representative of an important class of analytes) and LCs supported on metal perchlorate-decorated surfaces as a model system. Although O3 and Cl2 both diffuse through LC films and undergo redox reactions with the supporting metal perchlorate surfaces to generate similar initial and final optical states of the LCs, we show that a three-dimensional convolutional neural network can extract feature information that is encoded in the spatiotemporal color patterns of the LCs to detect the presence of both O3 and Cl2 species in mixtures and to quantify their concentrations. Our analysis reveals that O3 detection is driven by the transition time over which the brightness of the LC changes, while Cl2 detection is driven by color fluctuations that develop late in the optical response of the LC. We also show that we can detect the presence of Cl2 even when the concentration of O3 is orders of magnitude greater than the Cl2 concentration. The proposed methodology is generalizable to a wide range of analytes, reactive surfaces, and LCs and has the potential to advance the design of portable LC monitoring devices (e.g., wearable devices) for analyzing gas mixtures using spatiotemporal color fluctuations.","tags":["Computer Vision","Convolutional Neural Network","Gas Sensor","Liquid Crystal"],"title":"Sensing Gas Mixtures by Analyzing the Spatiotemporal Optical Responses of Liquid Crystals Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1636290000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636290000,"objectID":"463e533aff5f5782896cfb321d48fa88","permalink":"https://shenglijiang.com/talk/rapid-and-real-time-mixed-plastic-waste-analysis-using-infrared-spectroscopy-and-machine-learning/","publishdate":"2021-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/rapid-and-real-time-mixed-plastic-waste-analysis-using-infrared-spectroscopy-and-machine-learning/","section":"event","summary":"AIChE Annual Meeting 2021","tags":[],"title":"Rapid and Real-Time Mixed-Plastic Waste Analysis Using Infrared Spectroscopy and Machine Learning","type":"event"},{"authors":["Stas Zinchik","Shengli Jiang","Soren Friis","Fei Long","Lasse Hogstedt","Victor M Zavala","Ezra Bar-Ziv"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1633996800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633996800,"objectID":"b8565efcd6d268eba492cfc500b08125","permalink":"https://shenglijiang.com/publication/zinchik2021accurate/","publishdate":"2021-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zinchik2021accurate/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) framework and fast MIR (mid-infrared spectroscopy) for classifying different types of dark plastic materials that are commonly found in mixed plastic waste (MPW) streams.

CNNs are powerful machine learning models that highlight features from grid data to make predictions (regression and classification). The grid data object can be represented as vectors (in 1D), matrices (in 2D), or tensors (in 3D or higher dimensions) and can incorporate multiple channels (thus providing high flexibility in the input data representation). CNNs highlight features from the grid data by performing convolution operations with different types of operators. The operators highlight different types of features (e.g., patterns, gradients, geometrical features) and are learned by using optimization techniques. In other words, CNNs seek to identify optimal operators that best map the input data to the output data. A common misconception is that CNNs are only capable of processing image or video data but their application scope is much wider; specifically, datasets encountered in diverse applications can be expressed as grid data. Here, we show how to apply CNNs to new types of applications such as optimal control, flow cytometry, multivariate process monitoring, and molecular simulations.","tags":["Convolutional Neural Network","Process Systems Engineering"],"title":"Convolutional neural nets in chemical engineering: Foundations, computations, and applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shengli Jiang","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Recently, deep learning methods have improved the state of the art for this task because of their ability to learn useful features from the given data. By treating molecule structure as graphs, where atoms and bonds are modeled as nodes and edges, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to predict molecular properties. However, the design and development of GNNs for a given dataset rely on labor-intensive design and tuning of the network architectures. Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach to discover high-performing neural network architectures automatically. To that end, we develop an NAS approach to automate the design and development of GNNs for molecular property prediction. Specifically, we focus on automated development of message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to predict the molecular properties of small molecules in quantum mechanics and physical chemistry datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark. We demonstrate the superiority of the automatically discovered MPNNs by comparing them with manually designed GNNs from the MoleculeNet benchmark. We demonstrate that customizing the architecture is critical to enhancing performance in molecular property prediction and that the proposed approach can perform customization automatically with minimal manual effort.","tags":["Graph Neural Network","Neural Architecture Search","AutoML"],"title":"Graph neural network architecture search for molecular property prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shengli Jiang","JungHyun Noh","Chulsoon Park","Alexander D Smith","Nicholas L Abbott","Victor M Zavala"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1607385600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607385600,"objectID":"8aaa3c714d72a46c4feb34f0f786fef7","permalink":"https://shenglijiang.com/publication/jiang2021endotoxin/","publishdate":"2020-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jiang2021endotoxin/","section":"publication","summary":"Detection and quantification of bacterial endotoxins is important in a range of health-related contexts, including during pharmaceutical manufacturing of therapeutic proteins and vaccines. Here we combine experimental measurements based on nematic liquid crystalline droplets and machine learning methods to show that it is possible to classify bacterial sources (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella minnesota) and quantify concentration of endotoxin derived from all three bacterial species present in aqueous solution. The approach uses flow cytometry to quantify, in a high-throughput manner, changes in the internal ordering of micrometer-sized droplets of nematic 4-cyano-4′-pentylbiphenyl triggered by the endotoxins. The changes in internal ordering alter the intensities of light side-scattered (SSC, large-angle) and forward-scattered (FSC, small-angle) by the liquid crystal droplets. A convolutional neural network (Endonet) is trained using the large data sets generated by flow cytometry and shown to predict endotoxin source and concentration directly from the FSC/SSC scatter plots. By using saliency maps, we reveal how EndoNet captures subtle differences in scatter fields to enable classification of bacterial source and quantification of endotoxin concentration over a range that spans eight orders of magnitude (0.01 pg mL−1 to 1 μg mL−1).

Overall, we conclude that the combination of liquid crystal droplets and EndoNet provides the basis of a promising analytical approach for endotoxins that does not require use of complex biologically-derived reagents (e.g., Limulus amoebocyte lysate).","tags":["Convolutional Neural Network","Endotoxin","Liquid Crystal"],"title":"Using machine learning and liquid crystal droplets to identify and quantify endotoxins from different bacterial species","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1605531600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605531600,"objectID":"a2f00a153f6b0bcf07b1af16f57bdeab","permalink":"https://shenglijiang.com/talk/characterizing-complex-solvent-environments-in-acid-catalyzed-reactions-using-molecular-dynamics-simulations-and-3d-convolutional-neural-nets/","publishdate":"2020-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/characterizing-complex-solvent-environments-in-acid-catalyzed-reactions-using-molecular-dynamics-simulations-and-3d-convolutional-neural-nets/","section":"event","summary":"AIChE Annual Meeting 2020","tags":[],"title":"Characterizing Complex Solvent Environments in Acid-Catalyzed Reactions Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations and 3D Convolutional Neural Nets","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1605531600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605531600,"objectID":"aba7658817d2a3c11e985f6e81e9db70","permalink":"https://shenglijiang.com/talk/color-as-a-source-of-information-in-liquid-crystal-sensors/","publishdate":"2020-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/color-as-a-source-of-information-in-liquid-crystal-sensors/","section":"event","summary":"AIChE Annual Meeting 2020","tags":[],"title":"Color As a Source of Information in Liquid Crystal Sensors","type":"event"},{"authors":["Alex K Chew","Shengli Jiang","Weiqi Zhang","Victor M Zavala","Reid C Van Lehn"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1602806400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602806400,"objectID":"4d27e1cb2c1f7fdab28d422b764b6c1e","permalink":"https://shenglijiang.com/publication/chew2020fast/","publishdate":"2020-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chew2020fast/","section":"publication","summary":"The rates of liquid-phase, acid-catalyzed reactions relevant to the upgrading of biomass into high-value chemicals are highly sensitive to solvent composition and identifying suitable solvent mixtures is theoretically and experimentally challenging. We show that the complex atomistic configurations of reactant–solvent environments generated by classical molecular dynamics simulations can be exploited by 3D convolutional neural networks to enable accurate predictions of Brønsted acid-catalyzed reaction rates for model biomass compounds. We develop a 3D convolutional neural network, which we call SolventNet, and train it to predict acid-catalyzed reaction rates using experimental reaction data and corresponding molecular dynamics simulation data for seven biomass-derived oxygenates in water–cosolvent mixtures. We show that SolventNet can predict reaction rates for additional reactants and solvent systems an order of magnitude faster than prior simulation methods. This combination of machine learning with molecular dynamics enables the rapid, high-throughput screening of solvent systems and identification of improved biomass conversion conditions.","tags":["Convolutional Neural Network","Molecular Dynamics Simulation"],"title":"Fast predictions of liquid-phase acid-catalyzed reaction rates using molecular dynamics simulations and convolutional neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1573390800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573390800,"objectID":"d3a9077de1f367a2e5f2f88bcf422851","permalink":"https://shenglijiang.com/talk/liquid-endotoxin-sensors-using-liquid-crystals-and-machine-learning/","publishdate":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/liquid-endotoxin-sensors-using-liquid-crystals-and-machine-learning/","section":"event","summary":"AIChE Annual Meeting 2019","tags":[],"title":"Liquid Endotoxin Sensors Using Liquid Crystals and Machine Learning","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

The development of high-performance, low-cost capacitive electrodes is critical for enhancing CDI performance and scaling up its applications. Here, we report a novel design of highly compact, free-standing nanoporous carbon film electrodes for high-performance CDI. Such porous electrodes are fabricated by slip-roll compressing polypyrrole (PPy)-derived activated microporous carbon particles (PPy-AMC) with a small amount of polymer binder (5 wt%). The unique PPy-AMCs are synthesized from a rigid polymer precursor using a scalable carbonization-activation process, which is adopted in the manufacturing of commercial activated carbons. With small and uniform particle size, large specific surface area and short diffusion length, the PPy-AMC-based compact carbon electrodes offer very high salt adsorption capacity and enable very fast desalination, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art porous carbon-based CDI electrodes. This work provides an important strategy to design and fabricate compact yet porous carbon electrodes for efficient water desalinization and can be potentially extended to other applications such as energy storage and conversion.","tags":["Electrode","Deionization"],"title":"Highly compact, free-standing porous electrodes from polymer-derived nanoporous carbons for efficient electrochemical capacitive deionization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fei Ji","Yang Shi","Mingqian Li","Shengli Jiang","Gen Chen","Fang Liu","Zheng Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1531180800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531180800,"objectID":"71a3f2a3b9958ab749f419b3fb2753c5","permalink":"https://shenglijiang.com/publication/ji2018scalable/","publishdate":"2018-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ji2018scalable/","section":"publication","summary":"Porous carbon materials are of great importance for many applications such as energy storage, catalysis, and adsorption. Rational design and low-cost synthesis of carbon structures that can simultaneously offer high surface area and rapid ion/molecule transport properties remain desired for target functions. Here, we report a cost-effective and scalable synthesis of high surface area, size-uniform microporous carbon nanoparticles. A combination of using rigid polymer nanoparticles as the precursor, precarbonization, and activation process leads to carbon nanoparticles with a high surface area (up to 2789 m2 g–1), a large pore volume (up to 1.85 cm3 g–1), and a high packing density (0.5 g cm–3), which is due to the existence of a large amount of highly accessible micropores. Such a unique carbon structure exhibits not only large capacity but also rapid adsorption for both ions and small molecules, demonstrated in high-performance supercapacitors and as an efficient sorbent for removal of pollutants from water.

However, the relatively low cycling stability still prevents some of the most promising molecules to be used as lithium-ion electrodes. Herein, we used 1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide (NDI) as a model molecule to systematically investigate its intrinsic electrochemical property, including its electrolyte compatibility, maximum capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability in different organic electrolytes. Extensive physicochemical characterization, electrochemical measurement, and density function theory (DFT) calculation together show that the electrode–electrolyte interaction is the key factor determining its specific capacity and cycling stability. With a proper selection of electrolytes, NDI molecule, which was considered to be not stable for lithium storage, can achieve near theoretical capacity (based on two-electron reaction), very high rate capability, and high cycling stability. This study suggests the importance of understanding the fundamental electrode–electrolyte interactions in designing high-performance organic electrodes.","tags":["Porous Carbon","Nanoparticles","Energy Storage","Supercapacitors","Adsorption"],"title":"Understanding the electrochemical properties of naphthalene diimide: implication for stable and high-rate lithium-ion battery electrodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
